<h3></h3>
<h3>Flags and Parameters</h3>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">inputfile</span> argument is
optional, and and can be used to specify the MSWindows setup.exe file
from the installation CD,
if spyd2en is unable to locate this file automatically.<br>
<br>
The <b>-v</b> parameter enables verbosity. This may be of use in
figuring out what went wrong if it doesn't work.<span

<h3>Usage Details and Discussion</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The Spyder 2 instrument cannot
function without the presence of the instrument vendors PLD firmware
pattern for the device. This firmware is not provided with
Argyll, since it has not been made available under a compatible license.<br>
<br>
The purchaser of a Spyder 2 instrument
should have received a copy of this firmware along with their
instrument from the original vendor, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">spyd2en</span> enables their instrument, by
locating the firmware in the users copy of the
instrument install files.<br>
<br>
On Microsoft Windows or Apple OS X platforms, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">spyd2en</span> will look to
see if
the vendors drivers have been installed on the users machine, and
locate the firmware pattern from there. If the vendors drivers have
not been installed, or the user does not wish to install them, or no
vendors drivers are available for the users platform (i.e. Linux), then
<span style="font-weight: bold;">spyd2en</span> will also attempt to
locate the Spyder 2 installation CDROM, and make use of the firmware
pattern from there. In this case, the CDROM should be placed in a CD
drive prior to
running spyd2en. If your Linux system is not running
automount, or your automount is setup to mount CDROM's somewhere other
than <span style="font-style: italic;">/media</span>,<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> /mnt/cdrom</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">/media/cdrom</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">/cdrom</span>, then you will have to mount
the CDROM manually, and give spyd2en the path to the CDROM
setup/setup.exe
file as the argument <span style="font-style: italic;">inputfile</span>.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
NOTE </span>that under OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) you may need to run
spyd2en as root to be able to mount the CDROM's ISO partition. The
simplest way of doing this is to use the "sudo" commands. e.g. "sudo
spyd2en", which will then ask you to enter the root password.<br>
<br>
If the instrument firmware pattern is successfully located, then
spyd2en will create a <span style="font-weight: bold;">spyd2PLD.bin</span>
file in the same directory that
the spyd2en executable exists in, so that any other Argyll programs
residing with,
such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">spotread</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">dispcal</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">dispread</span>, can load the firmware into
the instrument.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span> that the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">spyd2PLD.bin</span> file created by spyd2en
contains the
proprietary
and copyrighted firmware provided by the instrument vendor, and while
the vendor has provided
the firmware to the end
user to facilitate the use of their purchased instrument, the
instrument vendor (typically) does not permit the user to distribute
such a file or
make copies for purposes other than making use of their own instrument.<br>
