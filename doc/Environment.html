    <h2> <u>Environment variables<br>
      </u></h2>
    The following environment variables affect behaviour:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE"></a>ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE</span><br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Normally Argylls tools expect that
      they are directly interacting with a user, and use a couple of
      techniques for communicating with them through the command line.
      One is to output progress information by re-writing the same
      display line by using a Carriage Return rather than a Line Feed at
      the end of each line. Another is to allow a single key stroke to
      trigger an action or interrupt operations.<br>
      <br>
      If the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE</span>
      environment variable is set, then:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Line Feed will be added to the end of each
      progress line.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any time it would wait for a single keystroke
      input, it will instead wait for and read the next character from
      stdin.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate flushing stdin, any return or
      line feed characters will be ignored, so a character other than
      return or line feed must be used to trigger activity.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that while a reading is being made, a
      character input can abort the reading, just as with normal
      interactive mode.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that on MSWin systems, the character and
      return or line fee characters must be written to stdin in a single
      operation (i.e. testing <span style="font-weight: bold;">ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE&nbsp;
      </span>mode manually will probably fail, because the character and
      return get split up.)<br>

a




      delay of 200 msec is allowed between changing a patch color in
      software, and that change appearing in the displayed color itself.
      For some instuments (ie. i1d3, i1pro, ColorMunki, Klein K10-A)
      ArgyllCMS will automatically measure and set an appropriate update
      delay during instrument calibration. In rare situations this delay
      may not be sufficient (ie. some TV's with extensive image
      processing features turned on), and a larger delay can be set
      using the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
          style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>ARGYLL_MIN_DISPLAY_UPDATE_DELAY_MS





environment




      variable, ie. ARGYLL_MIN_DISPLAY_UPDATE_DELAY_MS=400 would set a
      400 msec minimum delay.<br>

      </span></div>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:

          name="ARGYLL_DISPLAY_SETTLE_TIME_MULT"></a>ARGYLL_DISPLAY_SETTLE_TIME_MULT</span></span><br>
    <blockquote> Normally the display technology type determines how
      long is allowed between when a patch color change appears on the
      display, and when that change has settled down, and as actually
      complete within measurement tolerance. A CRT or Plasma display for
      instance, can have quite a long settling delay due to the decay
      characteristics of the phosphor used, while an LCD can also have a
      noticeable settling delay due to the liquid crystal response time
      and any response time enhancement circuitry. [ Instruments without
      a display technology type selection such as spectrometers assume a
      worst case.].<br>
      The ARGYLL_DISPLAY_SETTLE_TIME_MULT environment variable allows
      the rise and fall times of the model to be scaled to extend or
      reduce the settling time. For instance,
      ARGYLL_DISPLAY_SETTLE_TIME_MULT=2.0 would double the settling
      time, while ARGYLL_DISPLAY_SETTLE_TIME_MULT=0.5 would halve it.<br>

    <blockquote>By default ArgyllCMS uses the Bradford sharpened cone
      Chromatic adaption matrix in adapting the measured, absolute
      colorimetric test data to the <b>PCS</b> (Profile Connection
      Space) relative colorimetric D50 white point for all profile
      types. This makes the profile handling consistent with the widely
      deployed (HP &amp; Microsoft) sRGB and AdobeRGB profiles, as well
      as being recommended practice in modelling chromatic
      adaption.&nbsp; The ICC profile format though, specifies the use
      of a non-cone space XYZ adaptation (so called "Wrong Von Kries"
      chromatic adaptation) [ ICC Specification<br>
      ICC.1:2001-04 (ICCV2.4) Annex A, pp 66, equations A.1, A.2 &amp;
      A.3 ], so ArgyllCMS profiles have a very slight incompatibility
      with ICC profiles created strictly according to the ICC
      specifications, depending on how close to white Output (i.e.
      print) profiles media white is to the perfect diffuser. (Note that
      CMM's that strictly follow the ICC specifications have much more
      gross incompatibilities due to this, when dealing with the HP
      &amp; Microsoft sRGB and AdobeRGB profiles.) By setting this
      environment variable, Output (i.e. print) profiles will be created
      that better conform to the ICC specification, and&nbsp; therefore
      have better inter-interoperability with some other CMMs, at the
      cost of poorer color behavior.<br>

    <blockquote>The ICC V2 format originally provided no clear mechanism
      for Display profiles to use a modern chromatic adaptation
      transform in dealing with the D65 white point of typical displays.
      Profile makers ended up taking two different approaches :- one was
      to use a Bradford chromatic transform for the media (display)
      white to PCS D50 (this approach being used by the widely deployed
      HP &amp; Microsoft sRGB and AdobeRGB profiles, as well as
      ArgyllCMS profiles by default), and the other was to apply the
      Bradford transform to the measurement data and then disable
      Absolute Intent for display profiles by setting the
      mediaWhitePoint tag to D50. The latter approach was supplemented
      later on with the introduction of the ChromaticAdapation ('chad')
      tag, but this did not restore the Absolute Colorimetric capability
      to Display profiles. The latter approach has also been adopted
      more formally in the ICC V4 specifications. To improve restore the
      Absolute Intent for such profiles, ArgyllCMS will make use of the
      'chad' tag in such profiles when Absolute Colorimetric intent is
      requested, but by default does not create such profiles. Setting
      this environment variable causes it to create Display profiles in
      the fashion dictated by the ICC V4 spec. :- setting the
      mediaWhitePoint tag to D50 and storing the display media white to
      D50 matrix in the 'chad' tag. (This approach has slightly poorer
      accuracy for Absolute Intent than ArgyllCMS's default.) <br>

    <blockquote>By default the ChromeCast test patch source uses a
      special receiver application that gets the test patch data
      directly. By setting this environment variable to true, the
      default Google ChromeCast receiver will be used, making use of a
      local web server to provide the images. This is slower than the
      special reciever, but can be used as a fallback.<br>
