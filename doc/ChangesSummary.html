<h1> Summary of Argyll CMS Changes since last release</h1>
<h1>[V0.52 -&gt; V0.53] <br>
</h1>
<br>
The main changes to this version compared to the previous one, are some
important bug fixes. Some of the changes made in V0.52 CLUT profile
algorithms, unfortunately took the profiling backwards rather than
forwards. In penance, I've spent a lot of time cleaning up the
scattered data interpolation code, optimizing it, and more extensively
verifying it. The quality of profiles should be noticeably improved.
These fixes will affect profile, icclink (when gamut mapping is being
used), and also refine. An independent improvement has also been made
to the refine utility, so this promises to be more useful than in the
past. A serious bug in the default behaviour of targen has also been
corrected. The display calibration utility dispcal has been improved in
how it computes the maximum brightness it can achieve for a target
white point, and also its algorithm has been improved slightly, which
should lead to slightly more accurate results.<br>
<br>
Some features have also been added during all this:<br>
<ul>
  <li>CIEDE2000 Delta E support is now available in icclib, and can be
made use of in the profcheck, mppcheck and verify utilities.</li>
  <li>Hexagonal test charts can now be printed and read using the
Gretag SpectrScan, allowing more patches per printed sheet. The default
patch size has also been reduced slightly, increasing the patch count
as well.</li>
</ul>
As usual, a more detailed description of all changes is in the <b>log.txt</b>
file that accompanies the
source
code.
