<h1> Summary of Argyll CMS Changes since last release</h1>
<h3>For detailed change list please see the log.txt file.</h3>
<h1>[V1.0.4 -&gt; V1.1.0]</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Spyder3 and ColorMunki Design, Photo and Create instrument
support.</li>
  <li>Added a complete printer calibration system. This can work either
with a print system that supports per channel print calibration curves,
or purely using ICC profiling mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Default targen (OFPS) test point distribution has been re-written
to generate test points on the gamut surface, refine the point
locations when using a guide profile, and use a better error estimate
model to determine the test point locations. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Changed chartread strip reading mode to allow navigating about
the strips, saving a partially read chart, and resuming a partially
read chart.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improved and re-tuned
gamut mapping. This is noticeably smoother and better retains source
image detail.</li>
  <li>Re-tuned the cLUT profile creation smoothness vs.
accuracy.</li>
  <li>Fixed viewgam so that the number of gamuts that can be viewed is
unlimited. Also added error when computing intersecting volume if the
two gamuts are incompatible.</li>
  <li>Improved CMYK black generation control and smoothness near the
black point.</li>
  <li>Improved collink special black and colorant handling so that the
gamut mapping is consistent&nbsp; with the special black and colorant
mapping</li>
  <li>Changed profile/colprof to generate matrix tags for Display XYZ
PCS cLUT profiles, to improve compatibility with other CMMs.<br>
By default (-ax) the matrix tags will be a dummy transform that swaps
red and green, while using -aX will create real matrix tags.</li>
  <li>Added -V option to dispcal and dispread to allow use of i1pro
adaptive mode to give better low level consistency.</li>
  <li>Changed dispcal to default to -f 1.0 (assume black is all output
offset) to make it work in more sympathy to a typical display response.
Also changed default gamma to 2.4 for OS X 10.6 systems.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improved X11 XRandR CRTC detection.</li>
  <li>Added spotread option to save spectral reading of an illuminant
to a .sp file.</li>
  <li>Added Color Rendering Index (Ra) to spotread measurement results.</li>
  <li>Added i1pro &amp; ColorMunki flash measurement
support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>Improve reliability of detecting backwards read i1pro/Munki
strips.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in i1pro driver that subtly affected accuracy.</li>
  <li>Modified xicc/cam02 to clip the blue to avoid crazy behavior
outside the spectrum locus.</li>
  <li>Simplified the Linux installation instructions, particularly with
regard to USB and serial permissions.</li>
  <li>Added working MSWindows 64 bit libusb drivers, which will work on
Vista 64 and MSWindows 7 64 bit. Because of Microsoft's driver signing
requirements though, they won't be usable unless a driver code signing
workaround is used.</li>
  <li>Changed printtarg so that the TIFF output has the paper margin
subtracted from it. This is so that the resulting TIFF can be placed on
that sized paper without clipping or scaling. Set the margin to zero to
get a TIFF that exactly fits into the specified paper size</li>
</ul>
<h1>[V1.0.3 -&gt; V1.0.4]</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Modify icc/icclib to protect against integer overflow exploits,
and fixes to minor bugs. Bump icclib version to 2.11 to reflect this.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fix bug in spectro/hidio.c that can cause a crash (bus error) on
OS X for any program that accesses the instruments.</li>
  <li>Fix bug in xicc/xfit.c where too little memory was being
allocated.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>[V1.0.2 -&gt; V1.0.3]</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Added multi-TIFF and popularity filtering to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">tiffgamut</span>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Modified gamut mapping in <span style="font-weight: bold;">colprof</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">collink</span> to be consistent,
and have higher perceptual intent saturation.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed timeout problem with the Eye-One Display colorimeter.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fix segmentation fault in <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispread</span>.</li>
  <li>Fix out of memory error in <span style="font-weight: bold;">colprof
    </span>for systems with &gt; 3Gig Ram.</li>
  <li>Add support for the Eye-One Monitor spectrometer.</li>
  <li>Added -L option to <span style="font-weight: bold;">printtarg</span>
to suppress the i1pro target holder clip margin.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed bug in <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispcal</span>
when using -a with -t<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>[V1.0.1 -&gt; V1.0.2]</h1>
Various bug fixes, the main ones being:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed some <span style="font-weight: bold;">colprof </span>performance
and memory usage issues.</li>
  <li>Fixed issues with Eye-One Pro Rev B timeouts.</li>
  <li>Added new option to collink -fk, that forces 000K input to K only
output.</li>
  <li>Added device target value quantization option to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">printtarg</span>, as well as making it
default for
TIFF output files.put files.</li>
  <li>Fixed leak that was affecting <span style="font-weight: bold;">printtarg</span>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>[V0.70 Beta 8 -&gt; V1.0.0] <br>
</h1>
<br>
Apart from numerous bug fixes and many minor feature additions and
improvements, the main changes to this version compared to the previous
one are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Speedup in profile and device link generation (inversion code),
and better memory usage.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Support for embedded profiles in TIFF files.</li>
  <li>Support for installing and uninstalling and loading of display
profiles for all operating systems, and a micro CMM system for X11/Linux<br>
  </li>
  <li>Improved display calibration and profiling, including ambient
light adjustment.</li>
  <li>X11 XRandR 1.2 support added.</li>
  <li>Raster test charts now supported, as well as PS and EPS.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Guidance for installing on a wider range of systems.</li>
  <li>Fixed luminance and ambient calibration issues with various
instruments.</li>
  <li>Renamed "profile" to "colprof", and "icclink" to "collink" to
avoid clashes that have arisen with other executable names.</li>
  <li>Streamlined source code build system, for much easier building.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Installation archives now include a top directory, and gzip/tar
format for OS X and Linux.</li>
  <li>Added B2A table to input device LUT profiles by default.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
As usual, a more detailed description of all changes is in the <b>log.txt</b>
file that accompanies the
source
code.
<h1>[V0.60 -&gt; V0.70 Beta 8] </h1>

  <li>Added support for the Huey, Spyder 2, DTP20, Eye-One Pro,
DTP22/Digital Swatchbook, Eye-One Display 1 and 2 instruments.</li>
  <li>Changed to GPL Version 3 license.</li>
  <li>Countless other bug fixes and feature enhancements.<br>
