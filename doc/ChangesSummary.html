    <h1> Summary of Argyll CMS Changes since last release</h1>
    <h3>For a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complete</span>
      and more detailed list of changes, please see the log.txt file.</h3>
    <h1>[V1.3.7 -&gt; V1.4.0] 20th April 2012</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Modified spectro/ccxxmake so that a colorimeter can be used as
        a reference to make ccmx files if two .ti3 files are used. Added
        ref/ccxx.ti1 as convenient way of creating ccmx .ti3 files.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added dither/screening support for 8 bit output of render, and
        then made it available in target/printtarg.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added JPEG file support to imdi/cctiff, xicc/tiffgamut and
        xicc/extracticc. ICC profiles embedded in JPEG files can now be
        used anywhere a TIFF file with embeded ICC profile can be used
        as a source of an ICC profile.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed memory leaks in usbio.c, xdg_bds.c &amp; conv.c</li>
      <li>Fixed double memory free bug in icc/icc.c when iccdump'ing a
        profile that has a duplicate tag.</li>
      <li>Changed license of xicc/ccmx.[ch] to GPL2.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Made display calibration and profile making deal with displays
        without hardware calibration support (VideoLUT support) more
        graceful. Added tutorial section covering this.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added option to dispwin/dispcal/dispread/ccxxmake to redirect
        the test patches to a web browser via a local web server. This
        augments Argyll's existing local and remote display capability.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in spectro/i1d3.c which results in NAN if a low
        level readings drops to zero at a particular time. Improved
        refresh rate calibration accuracy. Fixed bugs in adaptive
        measurement logic that caused a channel to be pre-measured when
        it shouldn't. This seems to noticeably improve repeatability on
        refresh displays.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in ucmm/jcnf where it was failing to locate the
        correct profile for a display.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix bugs in ColorMunki Transmissive measurement mode
        calibration.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.6 -&gt; V1.3.7] 26th March 2012</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix regression in Spyder support - ccmx files were not being
        handled (bug introduced in 1.3.6).</li>
      <li>Fix packaging problem - Spyder4 MSWin .inf file was missing.</li>
      <li>Change dispwin so that it will install a profile when there is
        no access to the display VideoLUT if the profile has no vcgt.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.5 -&gt; V1.3.6] 19th March 2012<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added Spyder4 support. Note the need for spyd4en for access to
        a full range of Manufacturers calibrations. The Spyder4 can use
        .ccss calibration files too. Speeded up all Spyder instrument
        readings on brighter colors.</li>
      <li>Experimental ColorHug support is compiled in, but is disabled
        unless the environment variable "ENABLE_COLORHUG" is set. The
        ColorHug currently doesn't seem to work reliably across all
        platforms ArgyllCMS supports.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed and expanded display selection (-y flag) to be
        instrument specific. This is to support the Spyder4 and
        ColorHug, and adds a refresh display selection to the i1d3.</li>
      <li>Tweaked i1d3 integration times and added accurate refresh
        period calibration to the refresh display mode. Refresh display
        measurement times are double non-refresh displays. Improved i1d3
        period measurement logic to improve measurement speed and
        accuracy for dark colors.</li>
      <li>Changed i1disp measurement logic to try and make it more
        robust against light to dark changes during a reading. This may
        make it slightly less precise for LCD displays on bright colors
        (equivalent now to Refresh display precision).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added a -V option to spotread to allow tracking reading
        consistency.</li>
      <li>Changed ccxxmake to create default .ccss with just&nbsp; RGBW,
        and not to weight W. This may give better matching. Made
        corresponding change to CCMX, giving the white patch 1/4
        weighting of sum of all other patches.</li>
      <li>Fixed applycal so that it applies calibration to both A2B and
        B2A tables, to preserve softproofing.</li>
      <li>Fixed timeout in SpectroScanT reference transmission
        measurement. (Someone kindly donated me a SpectroScanT to test
        with!)</li>
      <li>Made DTP94 driver ignore with a warning any
        NEEDS_OFFSET_DRIFT_CAL_ERR after a full reset. It seems that
        occasionally a few instruments do this, and X-Rite don't appear
        to be prepared to treat this as an instrument fault.</li>
      <li>Added support for Datacolor SpyderCheckr (Thanks to Jos
        Pereira).</li>
      <li>Improved the ability of spyd2en to cope with slightly
        different setup.exe formats.</li>
      <li>Add support for NEC SpectraSensor Pro version of the i1d3.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.4 -&gt; V1.3.5] 24th October 2011</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix bug (crash) that affects ColorMunki design/photo display
        measurement. This also stops it restoring a calibration (-N
        flag).</li>
      <li>Add support for the OEM version of the i1d3.</li>
      <li>Fix bug that stopped ccxxmake being able to make ccmx's.</li>
      <li>Tweak gamut mapping to improve dark area mapping,
        non-monotonic profile inversion, and contrast preservation to
        small gamut.</li>
      <li>Kill i1ProfileTray.exe process if unable to open i1d3 on
        MSWin.</li>
      <li>Fix DTP20 chart printing - TID was sometimes incomplete. This
        shows up on a 4x6 chart.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.3 -&gt; V1.3.4] 31st August 2011</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the X-Rite i1 Display Pro and ColorMunki
        Display colorimeters. As part of this, added support for CCSS
        calibration files for the instruments and added CCSS support to
        ccxxmake (renamed from ccmxmake). Provide new tool i1d3ccss to
        translating and installing CCSS files as well as the
        manufacturers calibration files for these instruments. Added
        non-default observer support for these instruments too.</li>
      <li>Fix gamut code to ignore setting primary/secondary cusps that
        are unlikely to be true. This avoids buggy gamut mapping
        behavior for gamuts that are very small and odd shaped.</li>
      <li>Changed Linux USB code to avoid doing a
        set_configuration&nbsp; if possible, since the USB driver does
        this by default. This then avoids triggering a bug in the
        Spyder2, which allows it to work on Linux version without the
        reset_ep fix, and may also allow the Spyder to work better with
        USB hubs.</li>
      <li>Change printtarg for DTP20 to allow for variable patch size.</li>
      <li>Changed dummy display matrix table to have channels rotated
        rather than R &amp; G swapped, to make it more obvious.</li>
      <li>Added option to colprof to allow setting the default profile
        rendering intent.</li>
      <li>Enhanced spectro/fakeread so that it will process a .ti3 file
        that has been renamed to .ti1.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in matrix input profile white point selection, + add
        in slight neutral bias code used in clut profiles.</li>
      <li>New profcheck -I wasn't working - fix option parsing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.2 -&gt; V1.3.3] 13th May 2011</h1>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed compiler dependant bug in Eye-One pro and (possibly)
        Munki high res. spectral wavelength calculation.</li>
      <li>Add support for install variables DESTDIR and PREFIX in
        Jamtop. These can be set on the command line using "jam -s"</li>
      <li>Added targen -N parameter to allow adjustment of neutral axis
        patch density emphasis, as well as increasing the default. This
        should improve the result without needing to add explicit grey
        test patches.</li>
      <li>Added spectro/instlib.ksh script to assemble all the files
        needed for a standalone instrument library. Changed licence to
        GPLv2 for the files included in the instlib.zip file that is
        thus created. See spectro/instlib.txt for more details.</li>
      <li>Fix Jambase so that recent MingW compilers don't need extra
        .dll's</li>
      <li>Change Linux serial code to test ports using O_NONBLOCK</li>
      <li>Modify xspect &amp; illumread to improve realism of UV
        spectrum estimation.</li>
      <li>Fixed profile/txt2ti3 so that a sample name that looks like an
        integer is treated as text. (Fixes problem with latest
        ProfileMaker file).</li>
      <li>Added LCh option to spotread.</li>
      <li>Fixed numerical issue in scanin/scanrd.c, where large input
        rasters would cause fitting to fail.</li>
      <li>Modified colprof input chart white patch detection to slightly
        favour patches that are close to D50 neutral.</li>
      <li>Increase the default XYZ PCS A2B profile default smoothness.</li>
      <li>Improved cLUT input -u black &amp; white&nbsp; point
        extrapolation.</li>
      <li>Improved black point determination for devices that have
        extremely narrow gamuts doe to the use of custom inks.</li>
      <li>Added -Z option to colprof, to allow setting ICC attribute
        flags.</li>
      <li>Fix CIECAM02 to better match forward and backwards, to fix
        perceptual table white point.</li>
      <li>Add code to override X-Rite's new OS X drivers for ColorMunki
        and EyeOne. Note new installation instructions
        &lt;http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/Installing_OSX.html&gt;.</li>
      <li>Added -R flag to colprof, which restricts the range of the
        white, black for better compatibility with other programs.</li>
      <li>Fixed typo bug that prevented flash measurement mode from
        working.</li>
      <li>Replaced spectro/average with a new version that is more
        general.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in printcal not working with spectral only files.</li>
      <li>Added extra verbose output to printcal in which it computes an
        ideal power-like value to apply to the test chart values in
        targen.</li>
      <li>Modify the way that XYZ cLUT B2A tables are indexed, so that
        the white point is at the top corner of the grid.This should
        solve Photoshop CS4/CS5 complaining that XYZ LUT profiles are
        'defective'.</li>
      <li>Added option in xicc/xicclu to plot an arbitrary slice.</li>
      <li>Expand the number of i1 Display OEM devices that can be used.</li>
      <li>Made some changes to help compile on FreeBSD.</li>
      <li>Added another intent, "pa", Perceptual Appearance, which is
        the same as perceptual except that the grey axes are not forced
        into alignment, allowing the appearance parameters to have full
        affect, including altering the chromatic mapping.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in txt2ti3 - it wasn't creating an iRGB colorspace
        file for output device RGB files, causing warnings warnings and
        failures when mixed with other iRGB tool sequences. </li>
      <li>Added pathological case fix for target/ofps where the ink
        limit == di-2. </li>
      <li>targen was failing to proceed when fixed points happened to be
        numerically just over the total ink limit.</li>
      <li>Added more navigation options for chartread patch by patch
        mode.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Fixed bug in "chartread -r -H" that caused resume of
        i1Pro high res to fail with "The resumed spectral type seems to
        have changed".</li>
      <li>Modified profcheck so that it prints patch location if it is
        present in the .ti3 file.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal and dispread -K option to -J. Added -K option
        to dispcal as an alternate way of profiling a calibrated
        display, and also added a -K option to dispcal. </li>
      <li>Increased ColorMunki emissive auto scaling target "over"
        margin from 5% to 10% to allow more room for instrument drift
        during measurement.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Fix bug in winusb + i1Display, where dark CRT
        measurements timeout.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.1 -&gt; V1.3.2] 4th November 2010<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn off debugging that was accidentally left on in FWA code.
        Add gcc 3.3 PPC optimizer bug workaround to FWA code in
        xicc/xspect.c</li>
      <li>Change shaper/matrix profile back to using power curve as 0th
        order shape. Improve it with input &amp; output offsets and
        straight segment at zero. Make cLUT input -u black &amp; white
        point extrapolation use pure shaper curves with special tweaks.</li>
      <li>Increase dispcal native white target weighting from 10 to 50
        to encourage white to be device 1.0,1.0,1.0 more strongly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.0 -&gt; V1.3.1] 26th October 2010<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed MSWIN Vista/Win7 problem where having Task Manager
        running would stop display test window updating. Also fixed plot
        library to avoid the same problem.</li>
      <li>Swapped dispwin -E and -D flags, to make -D debug consistent
        throughout tools.</li>
      <li>Changed the ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE mode so that all return and
        line feed characters are ignored, so that they can be used
        freely to flush stdin without triggering anything.</li>
      <li>Fixed endless loop problem with chartread -r -p on fully read
        chart.</li>
      <li>Added -S option to chartread, that suppresses wrong strip and
        unexpected value warnings.</li>
      <li>Fix dispcal and spotread so that color temperature takes into
        account any non-standard observer (ie. the color temperature is
        the closest point on the spectrum locus as determined by the
        chosen observers interpretation of the Plancian or daylight
        spectrum.)</li>
      <li>Fix bug in libusb1 triggered on systems that support bulk
        continuation (Linux)</li>
      <li>Added 1964_10c observer to spectro/dispcal, to better allow
        comparison to the default numbers.</li>
      <li>Added recognition for Huey built into Lenovo W series Laptops.</li>
      <li>Fixed chartread/dispsup/spotread etc. so that -N isn't fatal
        if the instrument doesn't support it.</li>
      <li>Fixed dispcal to disable black &amp; white drift tracking
        during interactive adjustment.</li>
      <li>Added -s option to ccmxmake to allow the number of test
        patches to be set.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.2.0 -&gt; V1.3.0] 8th September 2010<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added option to <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispcal</span>
        and dispread that attempts to counteract instrument black drift
        and display white drift (-I option). This may help with
        instruments that haven't properly acclimatised to the
        measurement location, and LCD displays that also take some time
        to stabilise. The is a short discussion <a
          href="Scenarios.html#PM6">here</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added option to <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispcal</span>
        to allow specifying a non 1931 2 degree observer if a
        spectrometer is being used.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added new utility spectro/<span style="font-weight: bold;">ccmxmake</span>,
        which makes Colorimeter Correction Matrices for a particular
        Colorimeter + Display combination, using a Spectrometer as a
        reference. The resulting <span style="font-weight: bold;">.ccmx</span>
        file can then be used with <span style="font-weight: bold;">spotread/dispcal/dispread</span>
        (-X option) to improve the&nbsp; accuracy of the colorimeter on
        that particular display. See a discussion <a
          href="WideGamutColmters.html">here</a> and <a
          href="Scenarios.html#PM6">here</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in spotread's handling of emissive measurements. If
        the XYZ was computed from spectral, it was using a D50 white
        instead of no white reference.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in i1pro normal resolution wavelength calibration,
        introduced in V1.2.0.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed libusb V1.0 name to libusb-1.0A, so as not to clash
        with any official but different libusb V1.0 installation. [This
        may necessitate re-installing device drivers on MSWin.]</li>
      <li>Added support for HP DreamColor version of the i1 display.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix problem with ARGYLL_NOT_INTERACTIVE - reading from
        instruments was not actually possible, because polling for input
        was disabled.</li>
      <li>Adjust ColorMunki dark threshold to reduce misread reports.
        Add inconsistent data to debug output. Fix bug in adaptive mode
        - the integration time was sometimes&nbsp; too short. Set
        adaptive emissive target at 95% to allow a little more margin to
        saturation.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix problem with ColorMunki reporting erroneous inconsistent
        measurement errors. This shows up on display calibration.</li>
      <li>Fix some minor compiler warnings.</li>
      <li>Added direction indicators to xy values in dispcal
        interactive&nbsp; monitor adjustments. </li>
      <li>Fix bug in CIECAM02 viewing condition settings :- the
        enumerated conditions after "mt" are displaced by 1. (ie. "mt"
        is really "pc", "mb" is "mt", "md" is "mb" etc.) Added option
        -c:sn for auto surround from the Lv parameter (-c:l).</li>
      <li>Add option to illumread to average several readings. Fixed bug
        in the way illumread displays available instruments.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.1.1 -&gt; V1.2.0] 30 July 2010<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-worked gamut mapping to improve perceptual intent
        saturation levels, as well as improve highlight and shadow
        contrast. Added fine tuning to improve both smoothness and the
        precision with which the source is mapped to the destination.</li>
      <li>Added illumread, which allows measuring an illuminant and
        estimating its UV content, for better accuracy with FWA
        compensation.</li>
      <li>Use a modified/forked version of libusb V1.0, that supports
        Win2K (libusb0.sys) back end by default. Supports 64 but MSWin
        using a combination of WinUSB.sys and ptlibusb0.sys. [ The HCFR
        does not work on Win 64 bit though, due to its buggy USB
        implementation. ] NOTE that the included version of Libusb V1
        has been carefully tested with all supported instruments on all
        supported platforms,&nbsp; and includes many bug fixes needed
        for correct functioning. While bug fixes have been fed upstream,
        not all have been adopted. In particular there is a nasty race
        condition that has not, and may never be fixed upstream, as well
        as missing critical functionality (clearep()).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Modified colprof -p to allow different abstract profiles to be
        applied for each intent.</li>
      <li>Added -I option (imitation) to printcal, so that an existing
        devices response can be set as a target.</li>
      <li>Increase target/ofps.c vertex intersection retries from 10 to
        40 to give it a better chance of working with difficult
        profiles.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in plot that shows up on XP+, where the window isn't
        dismissed by the first keystroke, but only after it has been
        moved or resized.</li>
      <li>Changed CMYK black point to be natural, rather than the
        darkest point in the same direction and K only. This may wreck K
        only to black point matching, but it will stop printers with
        funny colored K ink from messing up the black point.</li>
      <li>Make Lacie Blue Eye colorimeter appear as an i1display.</li>
      <li>Improved i1pro matching to Original Manufacturers Driver (see
        doc/i1proDriver.html).</li>
      <li>Improved i1pro/ColorMunki patch recognition for better
        uniformity.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in ColorMunki driver scan mode calibration when
        instrument is more sensitive than usual.</li>
      <li>Added EV calculation to spotread -a<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

      </li>
      <li>Modified black curve to make sure that smoothed curve meets
        target level at boundaries.</li>
      <li>Added -M option to printtarg, for the case where the TIFF file
        is to include the margin.</li>
      <li>Fixed several build bugs in imdi code related to 64 bits.</li>
      <li>Fixed profile/colprof -u so that it is applied to matrix
        profiles too</li>
      <li>Changed tiffgamut to use one pass gamut hull finding and
        modified the smoothing so as to end up with a more closely
        wrapped volume.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in input matrix profiles introduced by the XYZ cLUT
        display matrix profile change, where the correct white and black
        point weren't being written.</li>
      <li>Added matrix only/linear algorithm option to profile/colprof,
        for raw camera profiling.</li>
      <li>Modified libusb/55-Argyll.rules for better compatibility with
        systems that have ACL installed but no ConsoleKit. Also set
        ID_VENDOR and ID_MODEL using. usb-db.</li>
      <li>Modified target/targen to cope better with case where adding
        nodes fails to determine vertex positions a lot of the time,
        causing extreme slowdown.</li>
      <li>Fixed colprof so that the per channel input curves for XYZ PCS
        B2A tables are actually scaled correctly.</li>
      <li>Changed link/collink to apply Y to L* curve if the input or
        output space is XYZ. Fixed the Y to L* scaling to make sure it
        only apples to XYZ space, and that the L* non-linearisation
        still applies to Y like device spaces.</li>
      <li>Modified scanin so that it ignores any alpha channels in the
        input .tiff file.</li>
      <li>Changed printcal so that it will create .AMP file with more
        than 4 channels. Also fixed up plotting to plot up to 10
        channels.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal and dispread so that a request for projector
        mode falls back to display mode if the instrument doesn't
        support a projector mode.</li>
      <li>Updated ref/CMP_Digital_Target-3.cht as it seems that the
        reference chart has columns labelled "2A - 2D" rather than the
        "AA - AD" that is actually printed on the chart...</li>
      <li>Altered xpsect FWA code to reduce overshoot artefacts due to
        filtering.<br>
      </li>

    <h1>[V1.0.4 -&gt; V1.1.0] 17th January 2010<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Spyder3 and ColorMunki Design, Photo and Create instrument
        support.</li>
      <li>Added a complete printer calibration system. This can work
        either with a print system that supports per channel print
        calibration curves, or purely using ICC profiling mechanisms.</li>
      <li>Default targen (OFPS) test point distribution has been
        re-written to generate test points on the gamut surface, refine
        the point locations when using a guide profile, and use a better
        error estimate model to determine the test point locations. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed chartread strip reading mode to allow navigating about
        the strips, saving a partially read chart, and resuming a
        partially read chart.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Improved and re-tuned gamut mapping. This is noticeably
        smoother and better retains source image detail.</li>
      <li>Re-tuned the cLUT profile creation smoothness vs. accuracy.</li>
      <li>Fixed viewgam so that the number of gamuts that can be viewed
        is unlimited. Also added error when computing intersecting
        volume if the two gamuts are incompatible.</li>
      <li>Improved CMYK black generation control and smoothness near the
        black point.</li>
      <li>Improved collink special black and colorant handling so that
        the gamut mapping is consistent&nbsp; with the special black and
        colorant mapping</li>
      <li>Changed profile/colprof to generate matrix tags for Display
        XYZ PCS cLUT profiles, to improve compatibility with other CMMs.<br>
        By default (-ax) the matrix tags will be a dummy transform that
        swaps red and green, while using -aX will create real matrix
        tags.</li>
      <li>Added -V option to dispcal and dispread to allow use of i1pro
        adaptive mode to give better low level consistency.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal to default to -f 1.0 (assume black is all
        output offset) to make it work in more sympathy to a typical
        display response. Also changed default gamma to 2.4 for OS X
        10.6 systems.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Improved X11 XRandR CRTC detection.</li>
      <li>Added spotread option to save spectral reading of an
        illuminant to a .sp file.</li>
      <li>Added Color Rendering Index (Ra) to spotread measurement
        results.</li>
      <li>Added i1pro &amp; ColorMunki flash measurement
        support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Improve reliability of detecting backwards read i1pro/Munki
        strips.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in i1pro driver that subtly affected accuracy.</li>
      <li>Modified xicc/cam02 to clip the blue to avoid crazy behavior
        outside the spectrum locus.</li>
      <li>Simplified the Linux installation instructions, particularly
        with regard to USB and serial permissions.</li>
      <li>Added working MSWindows 64 bit libusb drivers, which will work
        on Vista 64 and MSWindows 7 64 bit. Because of Microsoft's
        driver signing requirements though, they won't be usable unless
        a driver code signing workaround is used.</li>
      <li>Changed printtarg so that the TIFF output has the paper margin
        subtracted from it. This is so that the resulting TIFF can be
        placed on that sized paper without clipping or scaling. Set the
        margin to zero to get a TIFF that exactly fits into the
        specified paper size</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.0.3 -&gt; V1.0.4] 30th June 2009<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify icc/icclib to protect against integer overflow
        exploits, and fixes to minor bugs. Bump icclib version to 2.11
        to reflect this.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix bug in spectro/hidio.c that can cause a crash (bus error)
        on OS X for any program that accesses the instruments.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in xicc/xfit.c where too little memory was being
        allocated.<br>
