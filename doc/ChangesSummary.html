    <h1> Summary of Argyll CMS Changes since last release</h1>
    <h3>For a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complete</span>
      and more detailed list of changes, please see the log.txt file.</h3>
    <h1>[V1.5.1 -&gt; V1.6.0] 16th August 2013</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for <b>JETI</b> specbos 1211 and 1201 (Thanks
        to JETI for their support!)</li>
      <li>Added Video profiling &amp; 3dLut creation support for eeColor
        and MadVR. See video section in tutorial for pointers to
        relevant changes to tools. This includes support for MadTPG +
        various Video standard ICC profiles + verification workflow.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Linux profile installation will use <b>colord</b> if
        libcolordcompat.so is present on system.</li>
      <li>Fix <b>ColorHug</b> driver so that it is backwards compatible
        with FW 1.1.8</li>
      <li>Made sure that MSWin test colors are not color managed. This
        may affect Vista, Win7 and Win8.</li>
      <li>Changed spectro/dispwin.c so that null transform color
        matching is used for displaying test patches on OS X &gt;= 10.6.
        This should fix calibrating/profiling secondary displays on &gt;
        OS X 10.6. Note that the 32 bit 10.4 binary will still have
        problems on &gt; OS X 10.6.</li>
      <li>Changed <b>instlib API</b> ambient XYZ and spectral units to
        Lux. In previous versions of instlib they were Lux/pi.</li>
      <li>For those instruments that support it, made ambient readings
        honor refresh mode measurements, to improve repeatability when
        measuring regularly flickering light sources. (specbos, i1d3,
        i1disp).</li>
      <li>Changed spotread -ew mode to be Bradford chromatic transform
        rather than XYZ scaling, to better match Argyll ICC abs. vs.
        rel.</li>
      <li>Added support to xicclu to lookup colors though CAL files,
        both forward and backwards. Will also plot CAL file contents
        using -g.</li>
      <li>Added -Y R:rate option to spotread, dispcal, dispread &amp;
        ccxxmake to allow setting a chosen display refresh rate. This
        can be used with the Colormunki display, as well as situations
        in which refresh rate measurement is not reliable.</li>
      <li>By default printtarg will create PS and EPS files with a CUPS
        job ticket to disable color management. Use the -U flag to
        disable this.</li>
      <li>Added display update delay calibration support to i1pro and
        ColorMunki (just like i1disp3), to improve measurement times.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal &amp; dispread so that they wait up to 0.5
        seconds when reading dark patches after light ones to allow for
        display fall time. Added&nbsp; patch order optimization for
        display patch sets in targen to minimize the extra time.</li>
      <li>Changed dispwin daemon loader mode option from -E to -X. Added
        -E option to encode test patch colors in Video 16-235 range.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal verify option from -E to -z. Added -E option
        to encode test patch colors in Video 16-235 range.</li>
      <li>Added -E option to to dispread to encode test patch colors in
        Video 16-235 range.</li>
      <li>Changed CIECAM02 Flare model to distinguish between Flare from
        the image itself, and Glare from ambient light. This allows
        scaling Glare with ambient automatically. Changed enumerated
        viewing conditions for new Flare/Glare settings, changed all to
        Flareless to improve dark image behavior, while retaining Glare
        modelling. Tweaked brightness and ambient values.</li>
      <li>Improved i1pro hi-res mode to improve accuracy.</li>
      <li>Added Body Centered Cubic grid option to targen.</li>
      <li>Added -Yn flag to dispcal and dispread, which skips asking the
        user to place the instrument on the measuring spot.</li>
      <li>Improve robustness of i1d3 display update measurement code.</li>
      <li>Added support for applying calibration curves in collink.</li>
      <li>Changed spotread so that it won't fall back to emissive spot
        mode if an ambient reading is requested.</li>
      <li>Turned off B2A table clip map smoothing, as it seems to
        introduce reversals for some data sets, and provides little
        benefit.</li>
      <li>Fixed crash in ucmm/ucmm.c when loading certain profiles using
        dispwin (thanks to Torok Edwin).</li>
      <li>Fixed gamut mapping intent "rl" to really use relative L*a*b*</li>
      <li>Fix bug in cicam02 in V1.5.0 that causes some mapping problems
        in the red for collink -ir or -ila.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Changed cctiff so that it does lossless JPEG copy when there
        is no color transformation. This makes it more useful for
        embedding a profile.</li>
      <li>Fix xicclu so that it works with device links.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in shaper/matrix profile curves that caused random
        bumpy black behaviour (shaper curve optimization local minimum
        problem).</li>
      <li>Don't add colorant tag to .tiff files in cctiff unless it is a
        non-standard space, as Photoshop will barf on such files.</li>
      <li>Fix bug with Spyder not being able to break out of dispcal
        adjustment loop.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in xicc/xicclu, -K flag not being recognised.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in xicc/xmatrix.c introduced in V1.5 that prevents
        matrix only profiles from being created.</li>
      <li>libusb 1.0 is now deprecated in favor of native USB drivers.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.5.0 -&gt; V1.5.1] 8th March 2013</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix spectro/instlib.ksh and standalone instlib build.</li>
      <li>Turned off debug plot on using FWA.</li>
      <li>Changed link $(LINKFLAGS) location in link command line
        Jambase to get latest gcc working.</li>
      <li>Fixed new bug in matrix display profile creation that causes
        an inaccurate relative white point. This causes Photoshop to
        barf on the profiles.</li>
      <li>Added -m option to printcal.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in webwin that causes crash.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.4.0 -&gt; V1.5.0] 1st March 2013</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased ease of selecting ISO 13655:2009 M0, M1 and M2
        measurements using FWA comensation using any spectrometer that
        can take non-UV filtered measurements. M0, M1 or M2 can now be
        selected directly using the -f flag. [ArgyllCMS has been
        supporting ISO 13655 M0, M1 &amp; M2 well before the standard
        was created, thanks to its FWA compensation feature.]<br>
      </li>
      <li>Increased stability of i1d3 refresh display measurements by
        increasing integration time, and tweaking crossover from
        frequency to period measurement.</li>
      <li>Added i1pro Rev E (i1pro2) feature support. Uses RevE
        measurement mode, and does wavelength calibration. Uses RevE
        (internal) stray light reduction, and black level temperature
        compensation. The only Rev E feature not currently supported is
        U.V. measurement, which would improve the accuracy of FWA
        compensation. Rev E driver can be disabled and the legacy driver
        mode used by setting the ARGYLL_DISABLE_I1PRO2_DRIVER
        environment variable.</li>
      <li>Changed i1pro adaptive mode to avoid high gain mode, so as to
        give more consistent and longer integration times for low light
        levels.</li>
      <li>Changed ColorMunki adaptive mode to avoid high gain mode, so
        as to give more consistent and longer integration times for low
        levels. Added black level temperature compensation.</li>
      <li>Added spotread interactive function 'f' to read out the
        calibrate display refresh rate for instruments that have a
        refresh display mode, as well as an 'F' function that measures
        the refresh rate for instruments that support a refresh rate
        measurement function (colorimeters &amp; spectrometers).</li>
      <li>The Display Type selection option -y in dispcal, dispread,
        chartread, spotread &amp; ccxxmake now lists installed CCSS and
        CCMX files as a selection, rather than using the -X parameter.
        CCMX and CCSS files now have extra fields to indicate the
        refresh mode, an optional list of default UI selection
        characters, and (for CCMX files) the base display type they
        apply over (CB-n).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Tweaked CIECAM02 to improve behavior for extreme blue colors,
        so that the hue doesn't swing too far towards the cyan. This
        helps in the clipping behavior from colorspaces such as
        ProPhotoRGB.</li>
      <li>Made the input profile cLUT extra neutral axis extrapolation
        points the default for colprof -u and non -u profiles. Changed
        -u algorithm to work similarly to -U scale :- it sets the scale
        automatically. Relative colorimetric is therefore hue matched to
        the white reference patch, Removed colprof -un, as it seems
        unnecessary. Added colprof -uc, which clips cLUT colors over Y =
        1 to white.</li>
      <li>The spyd2en, spyd4en and i1d3ccss tools have been combined
        into, and replaced by a single oeminst tool.</li>
      <li>Fix problem with dispwin/dispcal/dispread -dweb and the latest
        Safari browser.</li>
      <li>Changed to a single ArgyllCMS.inf file for MSWin USB driver
        installation. This eases installation of more than a single type
        of instrument. Tested on MS Windows 8 and updated installation
        instructions.</li>
      <li>Dropped libusb for USB access, using native USB access
        instead. MSWin uses the libusb-win32 kernel driver. Moved the
        usb setup files from libusb1 to a new directory, usb.</li>
      <li>Added scanin support for ColorCheckerPassort.</li>
      <li>Updated OS X code to compile on 10.6 and 10.7 and (presumably)
        10.8 (64 bit compatible API used when compiling on those
        platforms, including Cocoa for the test patch window).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed udev file usb/55-Argyll.rules to eliminate the test
        for /lib/udev/udev-acl as a condition of using ACL_MANAGE, since
        I'm informed that it is deprecated in recent distribution
        releases (but who can tell, given the churn in the udev API).</li>
      <li>Deprecated -V flag (adaptive mode) in dispcal, dispread and
        ccxxmake, since this is now the default. Flag will be ignored
        with a warning. Added -ZA flag instead, to select non-adaptive
        integration time mode.</li>
      <li>spotread -d flag is deprecated, and is now a synonym for the
        -e flag, since it defaults to adaptive mode. Added -ZA flag
        instead, to select non-adaptive integration time mode. Also
        added -Zr and -ZR flags to allow testing of the refresh mode
        overrides.</li>
      <li>Migrated ArgyllCMS specific application runtime files (such as
        instrument blobs, calibration state &amp; calibration files) to
        an "ArgyllCMS" sub-directory rather than the generic "color"
        directory. On OS X also moved data files to below the
        "Application Support" sub directory. The old locations will be
        used as a fallback.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added support for Quato Silver Haze 3 OEM i1d3<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added support for X-Rite ColorMunki Smile colorimeter.</li>
      <li>Enable the ColorHug by default, although it isn't advertised
        as supported, since it doesn't yet work reliably on OS X.
        Updated ColorHug PCI VID &amp; PID</li>
      <li>For Spyder, emit a warning rather than error if the feature
        bits are missing for calibration tables.</li>
      <li>Added automatic adjustment of patch reading delay for i1d3, so
        that a more conservative (longer) default value (200 msec) can
        be used without impacting i1d3 speed. Also added environment
        variable ARGYLL_MIN_DISPLAY_UPDATE_DELAY_MS that can set a
        different minimum update delay.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug introduced in V1.3.6 that stops the dtp41 from
        being initialized properly.</li>
      <li>Improved black level readings derived from spectral values by
        allowing them to be -ve. <br>
      </li>
      <li>The instlib API has been modified quite extensively to make it
        more self contained and flexible, although the basic
        architecture remains the same.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.7 -&gt; V1.4.0] 20th April 2012</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Modified spectro/ccxxmake so that a colorimeter can be used as
        a reference to make ccmx files if two .ti3 files are used. Added
        ref/ccxx.ti1 as convenient way of creating ccmx .ti3 files.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added dither/screening support for 8 bit output of render, and
        then made it available in target/printtarg.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added JPEG file support to imdi/cctiff, xicc/tiffgamut and
        xicc/extracticc. ICC profiles embedded in JPEG files can now be
        used anywhere a TIFF file with embedded ICC profile can be used
        as a source of an ICC profile.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed memory leaks in usbio.c, xdg_bds.c &amp; conv.c</li>
      <li>Fixed double memory free bug in icc/icc.c when iccdump'ing a
        profile that has a duplicate tag.</li>
      <li>Changed license of xicc/ccmx.[ch] to GPL2+.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Made display calibration and profile making deal with displays
        without hardware calibration support (VideoLUT support) more
        graceful. Added tutorial section covering this.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added option to dispwin/dispcal/dispread/ccxxmake to redirect
        the test patches to a web browser via a local web server. This
        augments Argyll's existing local and remote display capability.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in spectro/i1d3.c which results in NAN if a low
        level readings drops to zero at a particular time. Improved
        refresh rate calibration accuracy. Fixed bugs in adaptive
        measurement logic that caused a channel to be pre-measured when
        it shouldn't. This seems to noticeably improve repeatability on
        refresh displays.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug in ucmm/jcnf where it was failing to locate the
        correct profile for a display.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fix bugs in ColorMunki Transmissive measurement mode
        calibration.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.6 -&gt; V1.3.7] 26th March 2012</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix regression in Spyder support - ccmx files were not being
        handled (bug introduced in 1.3.6).</li>
      <li>Fix packaging problem - Spyder4 MSWin .inf file was missing.</li>
      <li>Change dispwin so that it will install a profile when there is
        no access to the display VideoLUT if the profile has no vcgt.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.5 -&gt; V1.3.6] 19th March 2012<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added Spyder4 support. Note the need for spyd4en for access to
        a full range of Manufacturers calibrations. The Spyder4 can use
        .ccss calibration files too. Speeded up all Spyder instrument
        readings on brighter colors.</li>
      <li>Experimental ColorHug support is compiled in, but is disabled
        unless the environment variable "ENABLE_COLORHUG" is set. The
        ColorHug currently doesn't seem to work reliably across all
        platforms ArgyllCMS supports.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed and expanded display selection (-y flag) to be
        instrument specific. This is to support the Spyder4 and
        ColorHug, and adds a refresh display selection to the i1d3.</li>
      <li>Tweaked i1d3 integration times and added accurate refresh
        period calibration to the refresh display mode. Refresh display
        measurement times are double non-refresh displays. Improved i1d3
        period measurement logic to improve measurement speed and
        accuracy for dark colors.</li>
      <li>Changed i1disp measurement logic to try and make it more
        robust against light to dark changes during a reading. This may
        make it slightly less precise for LCD displays on bright colors
        (equivalent now to Refresh display precision).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Added a -V option to spotread to allow tracking reading
        consistency.</li>
      <li>Changed ccxxmake to create default .ccss with just&nbsp; RGBW,
        and not to weight W. This may give better matching. Made
        corresponding change to CCMX, giving the white patch 1/4
        weighting of sum of all other patches.</li>
      <li>Fixed applycal so that it applies calibration to both A2B and
        B2A tables, to preserve softproofing.</li>
      <li>Fixed timeout in SpectroScanT reference transmission
        measurement. (Someone kindly donated me a SpectroScanT to test
        with!)</li>
      <li>Made DTP94 driver ignore with a warning any
        NEEDS_OFFSET_DRIFT_CAL_ERR after a full reset. It seems that
        occasionally a few instruments do this, and X-Rite don't appear
        to be prepared to treat this as an instrument fault.</li>
      <li>Added support for Datacolor SpyderCheckr (Thanks to Jos
        Pereira).</li>
      <li>Improved the ability of spyd2en to cope with slightly
        different setup.exe formats.</li>
      <li>Add support for NEC SpectraSensor Pro version of the i1d3.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.4 -&gt; V1.3.5] 24th October 2011</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix bug (crash) that affects ColorMunki design/photo display
        measurement. This also stops it restoring a calibration (-N
        flag).</li>
      <li>Add support for the OEM version of the i1d3.</li>
      <li>Fix bug that stopped ccxxmake being able to make ccmx's.</li>
      <li>Tweak gamut mapping to improve dark area mapping,
        non-monotonic profile inversion, and contrast preservation to
        small gamut.</li>
      <li>Kill i1ProfileTray.exe process if unable to open i1d3 on
        MSWin.</li>
      <li>Fix DTP20 chart printing - TID was sometimes incomplete. This
        shows up on a 4x6 chart.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.3 -&gt; V1.3.4] 31st August 2011</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the X-Rite i1 Display Pro and ColorMunki
        Display colorimeters. As part of this, added support for CCSS
        calibration files for the instruments and added CCSS support to
        ccxxmake (renamed from ccmxmake). Provide new tool i1d3ccss to
        translating and installing CCSS files as well as the
        manufacturers calibration files for these instruments. Added
        non-default observer support for these instruments too.</li>
      <li>Fix gamut code to ignore setting primary/secondary cusps that
        are unlikely to be true. This avoids buggy gamut mapping
        behavior for gamuts that are very small and odd shaped.</li>
      <li>Changed Linux USB code to avoid doing a
        set_configuration&nbsp; if possible, since the USB driver does
        this by default. This then avoids triggering a bug in the
        Spyder2, which allows it to work on Linux version without the
        reset_ep fix, and may also allow the Spyder to work better with
        USB hubs.</li>
      <li>Change printtarg for DTP20 to allow for variable patch size.</li>
      <li>Changed dummy display matrix table to have channels rotated
        rather than R &amp; G swapped, to make it more obvious.</li>
      <li>Added option to colprof to allow setting the default profile
        rendering intent.</li>
      <li>Enhanced spectro/fakeread so that it will process a .ti3 file
        that has been renamed to .ti1.</li>
      <li>Fix bug in matrix input profile white point selection, + add
        in slight neutral bias code used in clut profiles.</li>
      <li>New profcheck -I wasn't working - fix option parsing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>[V1.3.2 -&gt; V1.3.3] 13th May 2011</h1>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed compiler dependant bug in Eye-One pro and (possibly)
        Munki high res. spectral wavelength calculation.</li>
      <li>Add support for install variables DESTDIR and PREFIX in
        Jamtop. These can be set on the command line using "jam -s"</li>
      <li>Added targen -N parameter to allow adjustment of neutral axis
        patch density emphasis, as well as increasing the default. This
        should improve the result without needing to add explicit grey
        test patches.</li>
      <li>Added spectro/instlib.ksh script to assemble all the files
        needed for a standalone instrument library. Changed licence to
        GPLv2 for the files included in the instlib.zip file that is
        thus created. See spectro/instlib.txt for more details.</li>
      <li>Fix Jambase so that recent MingW compilers don't need extra
        .dll's</li>
      <li>Change Linux serial code to test ports using O_NONBLOCK</li>
      <li>Modify xspect &amp; illumread to improve realism of UV
        spectrum estimation.</li>
      <li>Fixed profile/txt2ti3 so that a sample name that looks like an
        integer is treated as text. (Fixes problem with latest

        targen.</li>
      <li>Modify the way that XYZ cLUT B2A tables are indexed, so that
        the white point is at the top corner of the grid.This should

      <li>Made some changes to help compile on FreeBSD.</li>
      <li>Added another intent, "pa", Perceptual Appearance, which is
        the same as perceptual except that the grey axes are not forced

      <li>&nbsp;Fixed bug in "chartread -r -H" that caused resume of
        i1Pro high res to fail with "The resumed spectral type seems to

      <li>Modified profcheck so that it prints patch location if it is
        present in the .ti3 file.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal and dispread -K option to -J. Added -K option
        to dispcal as an alternate way of profiling a calibrated
        display, and also added a -K option to dispcal. </li>
      <li>Increased ColorMunki emissive auto scaling target "over"
        margin from 5% to 10% to allow more room for instrument drift

      <li>Adjust ColorMunki dark threshold to reduce misread reports.
        Add inconsistent data to debug output. Fix bug in adaptive mode
        - the integration time was sometimes&nbsp; too short. Set
        adaptive emissive target at 95% to allow a little more margin to
        saturation.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Re-worked gamut mapping to improve perceptual intent
        saturation levels, as well as improve highlight and shadow
        contrast. Added fine tuning to improve both smoothness and the
        precision with which the source is mapped to the destination.</li>
      <li>Added illumread, which allows measuring an illuminant and
        estimating its UV content, for better accuracy with FWA
        compensation.</li>
      <li>Use a modified/forked version of libusb V1.0, that supports
        Win2K (libusb0.sys) back end by default. Supports 64 but MSWin
        using a combination of WinUSB.sys and ptlibusb0.sys. [ The HCFR
        does not work on Win 64 bit though, due to its buggy USB
        implementation. ] NOTE that the included version of Libusb V1
        has been carefully tested with all supported instruments on all
        supported platforms,&nbsp; and includes many bug fixes needed
        for correct functioning. While bug fixes have been fed upstream,
        not all have been adopted. In particular there is a nasty race
        condition that has not, and may never be fixed upstream, as well
        as missing critical functionality (clearep()).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Modified colprof -p to allow different abstract profiles to be
        applied for each intent.</li>
      <li>Added -I option (imitation) to printcal, so that an existing
        devices response can be set as a target.</li>
      <li>Increase target/ofps.c vertex intersection retries from 10 to
        40 to give it a better chance of working with difficult
        profiles.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in plot that shows up on XP+, where the window isn't
        dismissed by the first keystroke, but only after it has been
        moved or resized.</li>
      <li>Changed CMYK black point to be natural, rather than the
        darkest point in the same direction and K only. This may wreck K
        only to black point matching, but it will stop printers with
        funny colored K ink from messing up the black point.</li>
      <li>Make Lacie Blue Eye colorimeter appear as an i1display.</li>
      <li>Improved i1pro matching to Original Manufacturers Driver (see
        doc/i1proDriver.html).</li>
      <li>Improved i1pro/ColorMunki patch recognition for better
        uniformity.</li>

        is to include the margin.</li>
      <li>Fixed several build bugs in imdi code related to 64 bits.</li>
      <li>Fixed profile/colprof -u so that it is applied to matrix
        profiles too</li>
      <li>Changed tiffgamut to use one pass gamut hull finding and
        modified the smoothing so as to end up with a more closely
        wrapped volume.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in input matrix profiles introduced by the XYZ cLUT
        display matrix profile change, where the correct white and black
        point weren't being written.</li>
      <li>Added matrix only/linear algorithm option to profile/colprof,
        for raw camera profiling.</li>
      <li>Modified libusb/55-Argyll.rules for better compatibility with
        systems that have ACL installed but no ConsoleKit. Also set
        ID_VENDOR and ID_MODEL using. usb-db.</li>
      <li>Modified target/targen to cope better with case where adding
        nodes fails to determine vertex positions a lot of the time,
        causing extreme slowdown.</li>
      <li>Fixed colprof so that the per channel input curves for XYZ PCS
        B2A tables are actually scaled correctly.</li>
      <li>Changed link/collink to apply Y to L* curve if the input or
        output space is XYZ. Fixed the Y to L* scaling to make sure it
        only apples to XYZ space, and that the L* non-linearisation
        still applies to Y like device spaces.</li>
      <li>Modified scanin so that it ignores any alpha channels in the
        input .tiff file.</li>
      <li>Changed printcal so that it will create .AMP file with more
        than 4 channels. Also fixed up plotting to plot up to 10
        channels.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal and dispread so that a request for projector
        mode falls back to display mode if the instrument doesn't
        support a projector mode.</li>
      <li>Updated ref/CMP_Digital_Target-3.cht as it seems that the
        reference chart has columns labelled "2A - 2D" rather than the

      <li>Spyder3 and ColorMunki Design, Photo and Create instrument
        support.</li>
      <li>Added a complete printer calibration system. This can work
        either with a print system that supports per channel print
        calibration curves, or purely using ICC profiling mechanisms.</li>
      <li>Default targen (OFPS) test point distribution has been
        re-written to generate test points on the gamut surface, refine
        the point locations when using a guide profile, and use a better
        error estimate model to determine the test point locations. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Changed chartread strip reading mode to allow navigating about
        the strips, saving a partially read chart, and resuming a
        partially read chart.<br>

      <li>Improved and re-tuned gamut mapping. This is noticeably
        smoother and better retains source image detail.</li>

        volume if the two gamuts are incompatible.</li>
      <li>Improved CMYK black generation control and smoothness near the
        black point.</li>
      <li>Improved collink special black and colorant handling so that
        the gamut mapping is consistent&nbsp; with the special black and
        colorant mapping</li>
      <li>Changed profile/colprof to generate matrix tags for Display
        XYZ PCS cLUT profiles, to improve compatibility with other CMMs.<br>
        By default (-ax) the matrix tags will be a dummy transform that
        swaps red and green, while using -aX will create real matrix
        tags.</li>
      <li>Added -V option to dispcal and dispread to allow use of i1pro
        adaptive mode to give better low level consistency.</li>
      <li>Changed dispcal to default to -f 1.0 (assume black is all
        output offset) to make it work in more sympathy to a typical

        outside the spectrum locus.</li>
      <li>Simplified the Linux installation instructions, particularly
        with regard to USB and serial permissions.</li>
      <li>Added working MSWindows 64 bit libusb drivers, which will work
        on Vista 64 and MSWindows 7 64 bit. Because of Microsoft's
        driver signing requirements though, they won't be usable unless
        a driver code signing workaround is used.</li>
      <li>Changed printtarg so that the TIFF output has the paper margin
        subtracted from it. This is so that the resulting TIFF can be
        placed on that sized paper without clipping or scaling. Set the
        margin to zero to get a TIFF that exactly fits into the
