<h2><b>spectro/i1d3ccss</b></h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
A special purpose tool that can either install CCSS files, or locate
and
translate X-Rite .EDR files to CCSS files and install them.<br>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Flags and Parameters</h3>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">inputfile</span> argument is
optional, and and can be used to specify the MSWindows setup.exe file
from the installation CD,
if i1d3ccss is unable to locate this file automatically. It can also be
used to specify an X-Rite .edr file (their equivalent to an Argyll
.ccss file), or a .ccss file. <br>
<br>
The <b>-v</b> parameter enables verbosity. This may be of use in
figuring out what went wrong if it doesn't work.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">-S</span> option allows
installing the .ccss file(s) in a local system location, rather than
the default user accessible location. With this option you may need to
run this as
superuser using the "sudo" command on OS X and Linux systems.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span><br>
<h3>Usage Details and Discussion</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">i1d3</span> family of instruments can make
use of display specific spectral calibration information, which
improves their accuracy when used on displays of a similar type. The
manufacturer provides 5 of these .edr calibration files that cover
various projectors and LCD displays with the instrument on the install
CD. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">i1d3ccss</span> utility
allows you to translate these files into Argyll <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CCSS</span> format, and install them where
the measurement tools can automatically find them, so that they can be
selected using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-X</span> option.<br>
Also provided with Argyll in the ref directory is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CRT.ccss</span> to cover CRT type displays.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">i1d3ccss</span> allows this file to be
installed too.<br>
<br>
On Microsoft Windows or Apple OS X platforms, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">i1d3ccss</span> will look to
see if
the manufacturers drivers have been installed on the users machine, and
locate the firmware pattern from there. If the manufacturers drivers
have
not been installed, or the user does not wish to install them, or no
manufacturers drivers are available for the users platform (i.e.
Linux), then <span style="font-weight: bold;">i1d3ccss</span> will
also attempt to
locate the i1d3 installation CDROM, and make use of the .edr files from
there. In this case, the CDROM should be placed in a CD
drive prior to
running i1d3ccss. If your Linux system is not running
automount, or your automount is setup to mount CDROM's somewhere other
than <span style="font-style: italic;">/media</span>,<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> /mnt/cdrom</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">/media/cdrom</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">/cdrom</span>, then you will have to mount
the CDROM manually, and give i1d3ccss the path to the CDROM
setup/setup.exe
file as the argument <span style="font-style: italic;">inputfile</span>.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
NOTE </span>that under <span style="font-weight: bold;">OS X 10.6</span>
(Snow Leopard) and latter, you may need to run i1d3ccss as root to be
able to mount the CDROM's ISO partition. The
simplest way of doing this is to use the "sudo" commands. e.g. "sudo
i1d3ccss", which will then ask you to enter the root password.<br>
<br>
If the .edr files are successfully located, then i1d3ccss will
translate them to .ccss files and copy them into a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span> subdirectory of the users home
directory, or if the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-S l</span>
option is used, will store it
in a system wide location. (the <a
 href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html">XDG
Base
Directory
specifications</a> are used as a basis for storing the
file). Programs that access instruments such as&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">spotread</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">dispcal</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">dispread</span>, can then locate and list
the installed .ccss as possible choices for the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">-X</span> option.<br>
<br>
If you are going to use the same CCSS file all the time, then you may
want to set the <a href="Environment.html">ARGYLL_COLMTER_CAL_SPEC_SET</a>
environment variable.<br>
