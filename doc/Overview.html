  <title>Argyll Overview</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>
<u>Overview</u></h2>
Many commercial and research electronic color correction systems have
been
developed over the years, but all state-of-the-art systems are
proprietary,
and their technology is jealously guarded. This makes this interesting
subject area a difficult one to both explore, and to bridge the gap
between
theory and practice.
<p>Argyll was written to allow me to improve my understanding and
expertise
in the color area, and as a platform to try out ideas for alternate
approaches
to electronic color correction, as well as developing new advanced
features.
</p>
<p>I hope that by making the source code available under "Free" and
"Open
Source" licences, that other researchers and experimenters will also
find
it of interest and value. I also hope that it may be attractive as a
software platform on which future research and advances in electronic
color correction
systems can be based.
</p>
<p>To complement this aim, I hope at some stage to turn my notes made
in
the creation of this software into a more readable
explanation of how Argyll works, and the principles on which it is
based.
</p>
<p>What Argyll currently does:<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Creates display
calibration curves.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>Creates CMYK/RGB/Grey device optimized target values.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Creates a PostScript or EPS target file.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Reads the printed target file using an Xrite DTP51
Colorimeter,
DTP41 Spectrometer, Gretag SpectroScan, or a suitably calibrated RGB
scanner.
  <p>Creates ICC CMYK or RGB output profiles, including gamut mapped
perceptual
and saturation intent tables. </p>
  <p>Recognizes and then extracts the RGB values from a TIFF scan of an
IT8
chart, ready for scanner profile creation. </p>
  <p>Use RGB target values to exercise a CRT or LCD display, and read
the
resulting values using an Xrite DTP92 colorimeter or Gretag Spectrolino.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Create an ICC CLUT or matrix based RGB monitor profile.
  <p>Links device ICC profiles using either simple or advanced gamut
mapping
linking options, to create an ICC device link profile. </p>
  <p>Converts 8 or 16 bit TIFF files from one colorspace to another
using
two ICC device profiles, or an ICC device link profile. </p>
  <p>Allows the extraction of gamut boundary maps from ICC profiles and
TIFF
files. </p>
  <p>Allows visualizing gamuts using VRML </p>
  <p>Runs on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
What it doesn't yet do, but may do in the future:
</p>
<blockquote>Any direct support for monochrome profiles.
  <p>Support ICC V4 profiles. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
