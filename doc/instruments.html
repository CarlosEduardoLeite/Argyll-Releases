<h3><a name="strip"></a>Strip reading instruments</h3>
When used with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">DT20</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">DTP41</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">DTP51</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Eye-One Pro</span> strip reading
instrument,
chartread
will first establish communications with the instrument, and then set
it
up ready to read the strips. The strips are labeled A to ZZ, and for
each
strip it will prompt:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About to read strip XX&nbsp; :<br>
<br>
where XX is the strip label. For the DTP51 you should feed the strip
into the instrument, and the microswitch will trigger the read. For the
DTP41 you should line the appropriate strip up
in
the machine, and press its button. For the Eye-One Pro you should set
the guide to the appropropriate strip, place the instrument ahead of
the first patch, and then press and hold the instruments button. When
you hear a beep from the computer, you can then move the instrument
steadily over the patches, releasing the button after the instrument is
past the last patch. Moving the instrument too fast or changing speeds
may cause a mis-read, or a scan with few samples read per patch. Using
the Eye-One Pro the strip may be scanned from either direction.<br>
<br>
Note
that you may have to check that system alert sounds are enabled and at
a suitable volume to in order to hear the beep prompt. For the Eye-One
Pro, a second beep will sound after a successfully read strip, or a
double beep will sound,&nbsp; indicating a failure or warning that
needs attention. See also the note on Linux in <a
 href="Installing.html">installation</a>.<br>
<br>
If the strip is read successfully, the line will be completed with:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About to read strip&nbsp; XX&nbsp; :&nbsp; Strip
read
OK<br>
<br>
If there is an error of some sort, a message will be issued, and you
will
be asked whether to abort the chart reading, or retry the<br>
failed strip:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About to read strip X&nbsp; : read_strip returned
'Strip
misread' (Bad reading)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strip read failed due to misread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit Esc to give up, any other key to retry:<br>
<br>
If the strip is read successfully, but the patches values don't seem to
be what is expected, you will get the following type of warning:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About to read strip&nbsp; XX&nbsp; :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Warning) Seem to have read strip&nbsp; YY&nbsp;
rather
than&nbsp;
XX !<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit Return to use it anyway, any other key to retry,
Esc, ^C or Q to give up:<br>
<br>
This could be because you have accidentally read the wrong strip (a
common mistake), or it could be that the device response is so
different from what is expected that warning is erroneous, or you may
get a lot of these sorts of warnings if you are accidentally reading
the wrong chart. <br>
If you are sure you lined up the correct strip, then hit return,
otherwise
line the appropriate strip up again, and hit some other key (ie. space).<br>
Erroneous warnings are less likely if a previous profile for a device
was given to targen to set more accurate expectations.<br>
<br>
You may also see the following type of warning:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About to read strip&nbsp; XX&nbsp; :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Warning) Patch error YY.YYY (&gt;35 not good,
&gt;95 bad)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is at least one patch with an very unexpected
response!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit Return to use it anyway, any other key to retry,
Esc, ^C or Q to give up:<br>
<br>
Similar to the previous warning, this indicates that while the right
strip appears to have been read, one of the patch readings is quite
different to what is expected. This may indicate an error of some sort
(ie. damaged test chart, or bad instrument positioning), or may be
erroneous if the actual device response is quite different to the
expectation.<br>
Erroneous warnings are less likely if a previous profile for a device
was given to targen to set more accurate expectations.<br>
<br>
You can abort the whole process at any time by hitting Escape.<br>

<h3><a name="xy"></a>X-Y Table instruments</h3>
When you are using an XY table type instrument, such as a Gretag
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SpectroScan</span>,
&nbsp;chartread will first establish communications with the
instrument,
and then set it up ready to read the chart. You will be prompted for
each
sheet with a message such as:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please make sure that the white reference is in slot
1, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place sheet 1 of 4 on table, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit return to continue, Esc to give up<br>
<br>
After hitting return you will be prompted to line up three squares on
the
sheet, one at a time:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the XY table controls, locate patch A1 with
the
sight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then hit return to continue, Esc to give up<br>
<br>
On completing this, the instrument will commence reading each sheet.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a name="dtp51"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">DTP51<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></span>The DTP51's switch is triggered by inserting a strip into
the slot.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<a name="dtp20"></a>DTP20</span><br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">DTP20</span> has a couple of
unique features that Argyll can take advantage of. One is that it can
operate un-tethered (off line). A whole chart can be read un-tethered
by first
clearing any previous readings in the instrument, then reading the
chart TID strip, before reading all the other strips. The instrument
can then be connected up to <span style="font-weight: bold;">chartread</span>,
which will recognize the chart, and download all the measurements.<br>
If there is no chart in the instrument when chartread connects to it,
then it will use the strip by strip tethered mode, just like the other
strip instruments. If the right number of spot readings are present in
the instrument, these will be used by <span style="font-weight: bold;">chartread</span>
too.<br>
<br>
Un-tethered spot measurements can also be read in using&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">spotread</span>,
which will notice the stored readings, and offer to print them out, or
they can be ignored, and tethered readings taken. This will
clear any saved spot readings.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span> that tethered (on-line)
strip reading
will only work if the firmware in the device is version 1.03 or
greater. You can check the firmware version by running with the verbose
option: <span style="font-weight: bold;">-v<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="i1p"></a>Eye-One Pro<br>
<br>
Patch recognition:</span><br>
<br>
For the best chances of good patch recognition, the instrument should
be drawn smoothly and not too rapidly over the strip. If there is a
misread, try slowing down slightly. The Rev A. instrument has a slower
sampling rate than the latter
revision instruments, and hence must be used a bit more slowly.
Generally a higher quality set of readings will result if slower scans
are used, since there wil then be more samples averaged for each patch.<br>
<br>
In <a href="chartread.html">chartread</a>, the -<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">T ratio</span>
argument modifies the patch consistency tolerance threshold for the
Eye-One Pro. In recognizing patches
in a strip, the instrument takes multiple readings as the strip is
read, and then divide the readings up into each patch. It then
check the consistency of the multiple readings corresponding to each
patch, and reject the measurement if they are too inconsistent. For
some media (ie. a coarser screens, fabric etc.) the default tolerance
may be unreasonably tight, so the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-T
ratio</span> argument can be used to modify this criteria. To loosen
the tolerance, use a number greater than 1.0 (ie. 1.5, 2.0).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Special features:</span><br>
<br>
A feature unique to Argyll when used with the Eye-One
Pro, is the high resolution spectral mode. This returns spectral
measurements at 3.333 nm spacing, rather than the default 10nm spacing,
and also extends the range of wavelengths slightly. This high
resolution may assist in giving better accuracy for "peaky" emissive
sources such as illuminants and displays. The high resolution mode is
selected by using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-H</span> flag
on the command line to <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispcal</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">dispread</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">chartread</span>, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">spotread</span>. It can also be toggled on
and off within <span style="font-weight: bold;">spotread</span> using
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">h</span> key. The extended range
down to 350nm may give some information about an illuminants ultra
violet content, although the accuracy of the readings between 350-380,
and 730-750nm should not be relied upon.<br>

The accuracy of this instrument does not seem to be comparable to the
commercial
instruments when used for measuring displays, particularly in the area
of measuring dark colors, and I've seen the best results when used with
a CRT display. It may well give good results in calibrating projectors,
since this was what it was designed to do.<br>

Important Note </span>about the ColorVision Spyder 2 instrument
support:<br>
<br>
This instrument cannot function without the driver
software having access to the vendor supplied PLD firmware pattern for
it.<br>
This firmware is not provided with Argyll, since it
is not available under a compatible license.<br>
<br>
The purchaser of a Spyder 2 instrument
should have received a copy of this firmware along with their
instrument, and
should therefore be able to enable the Argyll driver for this
instrument by
using the <a href="spyd2en.html">spyd2en</a> utility.<br>
