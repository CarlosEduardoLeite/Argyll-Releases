<h2>
<u>Compiling the Source Code</u></h2>
If you have downloaded the source code package, then you will need to
read the following instructions in order to compile and then run any of
the utilities. If you have downloaded one of the platform specific
executable package, then the executables don't need to be compiled, and
the following instructions are not relevant.<br>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First&nbsp; setup JAM:</span><br>
</h5>
Argyll makes use of a build system called <a
 href="http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html">Jam/MR</a>. Jam is cross
platform, highly customizable and flexible. It uses a concise, scalable
and platform neutral configuration files, and is fast.<br>
<p>If you do not already have Jam 2.5 on your system, you will need to
install it. [It may be available as an RPM for Linux systems.] Jam/MR
is available from <a href="ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/jam/jam-2.5.zip">&lt;ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/jam/&gt;</a>
You'll
want to bootstrap it up using its Makefile - see the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">README</span> file that comes with Jam for
more information. You may want to apply the patch <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">jam.patch</span> included in Argyll to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">jam.c</span> so that it uses the
environment variable <span style="font-weight: bold;">JAMBASE</span>,
and then setting this environment variable to point to the Argyll
Jambase. The patch also fixes a non-critical bug that affects building
using MingW. Note that building jam results in an executable <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">jam0</span> that you will want to rename
and install in an appropriate place on your system. A <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">pre-patched</span> archive of Jam is
available <a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/ajam-2.5.2.zip">here</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>An alternative to the original Jam may be <a
 href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/jam/index.html">ftjam</a>, which
is appears to be backwards compatible with the original Jam/MR.</p>
<p>The
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Jambase</span>
I am using for Argyll is different to the default Jambase provided with
Jam and compiled into it,&nbsp; and you need to arrange to use this
when you compile Argyll. You can tell Jam to use an alternate Jambase
using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-f</span> option, or by
setting the environment variable <span style="font-weight: bold;">JAMBASE</span>
to point to the Argyll Jambase if you applied the Argyll patch to jam.
Another method would be to create a shell alias of jam
that invokes jam using the -f flag, or to create a script that provides
the -f option to point to the Argyll Jambase. Argyll will not build
properly if you use the wrong Jambase.
</p>
If you are running on Mac OSX, then even though OSX comes with a
version
of Jam/MR in the development system, you will need to download, build
and
install a normal version of Jam/MR Version 2.5 or later from perforce,
to be able to build Argyll. This is due to Apple changing their version
of Jam sufficiently to make it incompatible with normal Jamfiles :-(.<br>
<p>On OSX what I did was to name the "normal" Jam ajam, and then setup
a jam shell script to invoke it something like this: "ajam
-f~/src/argyll/Jambase
$*", and to make sure that my script is ahead of Apples jam in my
$PATH.&nbsp;
The makeall.ksh script or Makefile will run Jam with the -f flag.</p>
<p>You may also have to set the appropriate environment variable to
tell the Jambase which compiler you are using.<br>
</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then compile Argyll:</span><br>
</h5>
<p>Once you've got a working Jam, you simply have to unzip the
argyll.zip file, and it will create a top level directory <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Argyll_VX.X.X</span>, where X.X.X is the
version number, and you can then cd into this directory and run <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">jam</span>. <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204);"></span><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204);"></span>For a faster build on a
multiprocessor system you may like to use the -j option&nbsp; to do a
parallel build, e.g. <span style="font-weight: bold;">jam -j3</span>.
To install the executables in the bin directory and the sample files
into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ref</span> directory, run <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">jam install</span>. To remove everything
that has been built, run <span style="font-weight: bold;">jam clean</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>Something to watch on the Intel versions of OS X 10.4, is that your
shell environment variable $MACHTYPE may be incorrect. On Intel 10.4 it
should be i386-apple-darwin8.0, but there are bugs in Apples
distribution.</p>
<p>If&nbsp; you are on MSWindows and have the DDK installed, then it is
worth setting the environment variables %DDK_INC_PATH% and
%DDK_LIB_PATH% to the header and DDK library directories, so that the
MSWindows HID driver interface will get enabled. This allows accessing
USB instruments&nbsp;
that are labeled as HID devices (such as the Gretag Huey) , without
having to install the libusb kernel drivers, and this will also allow
the Huey to be accessed on Vista 64.<br>
</p>
<p>To build a particular sub directory only, cd to the directory and
simply run <span style="font-weight: bold;">jam.</span><br>
