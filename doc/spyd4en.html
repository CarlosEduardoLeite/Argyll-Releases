    <h3>Summary</h3>
    A special purpose tool that enables the full range of Spyder 4
    colorimeter calibration selections.<br>

    <h3></h3>
    <h3>Flags and Parameters</h3>
    The <span style="font-style: italic;">inputfile</span> argument is
    optional, and and can be used to specify the MSWindows setup.exe
    file
    from the installation CD (or possibly downloaded from the
    manufacturers
    website),
    if spyd4en is unable to locate this file automatically on the CD.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>-v</b> parameter enables verbosity. This may be of use in
    figuring out what went wrong if it doesn't work, and where the file
    ends up.<br>
    <br>
    The <span style="font-weight: bold;">-S</span> option allows
    installing the calibration information file in a local system
    location, rather than
    the default user accessible location. You may need to run this as
    superuser using the "sudo" command on Linux systems.<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
          style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span><br>
    <h3>Usage Details and Discussion</h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The Spyder 4 instrument does
    not have the full range of vendor instrument calibration options
    without the presence of the instrument vendors calibration
    information for the device. This calibration information is not
    provided with
    Argyll, since it has not been made available under a compatible
    license.<br>
    <br>
    The purchaser of a Spyder 4 instrument
    should have received a copy of this calibration information along
    with their
    instrument from the original vendor, and <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">spyd4en</span> enables the full range of calibration choice
    for their instrument, by
    locating the necessary information in the users copy of the
    instrument install files.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">spyd4en</span> will attempt
    to
    locate the Spyder 4 installation CDROM, and make use of the
    calibration information from there. The CDROM should be placed in a
    CD
    drive prior to
    running spyd4en. If your Linux system is not running
    automount, or your automount is setup to mount CDROM's somewhere
    other
    than <span style="font-style: italic;">/media</span>,<span
      style="font-style: italic;"> /mnt/cdrom</span>, <span
      style="font-style: italic;">/media/cdrom</span> or <span
      style="font-style: italic;">/cdrom</span>, then you will have to
    mount
    the CDROM manually, and give spyd4en the path to the CDROM
    setup/setup.exe
    file as the argument <span style="font-style: italic;">inputfile</span>.<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
      NOTE </span>that under OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) you may need to
    run
    spyd4en as root to be able to mount the CDROM's ISO partition. The
    simplest way of doing this is to use the "sudo" commands. e.g. "sudo
    spyd4en", which will then ask you to enter the root password.<br>
    <br>
    If the instrument calibration information is successfully located,
    then
    spyd4en will create a <span style="font-weight: bold;">spyd4cal.bin</span>
    file in a subdirectory of the users home directory, or if the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">-S l</span> option is used, will store
    it
    in a system wide location. (the <a
href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html">XDG
      Base
      Directory
      specifications</a> are used as a basis for storing the
    file). The instrument driver can then locate and load
    the calibration information for the instrument.<br>
