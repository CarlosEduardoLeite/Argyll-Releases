        style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Unpacking the .zip archive:</span></h3>
    You will need to unzip the downloaded file in the location you have
    chosen to hold the executable files (perhaps somewhere like <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">\bin</span>). I would <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> put them in <span
      style="font-style: italic;">\Program Files</span>, since spaces in
    directory or file names and command line environments are a very bad
    mix, and will cause you endless problems. The archive will create a
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> top level directory <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Argyll_VX.X.X</span>, where X.X.X is
    the version number, and the executables will be in <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Argyll_VX.X.X/bin</span>.
    <h3><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Making the tools
        accessible:</span></h3>
    You should also configure your %PATH% environment variable to give
    access to the executables from your command line environment.<br>
    <br>
    For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows 7</span>, look in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Menu -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; System And
    Security -&gt; System -&gt; Change Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt;
    Environment Variables<br>
    <br>
    For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vista</span>, look in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Menu -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; System And
    Maintenance -&gt; System -&gt; Change Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt;
    Environment Variables<br>
    <br>
    For <span style="font-weight: bold;">XP and 2000 </span>look in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;ControlPanel-&gt;System-&gt;Advanced-&gt;EnvironmentVariables<br>
    <br>
    For <span style="font-weight: bold;">NT 4</span> look in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;ControlPanel-&gt;System-&gt;Environment<br>
    <br>
    You want to add the directory you've chosen to your %PATH%, which is
    a System Variable. Normally you would add this to the end of the
    current setting, separated by a ';'.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;So if the current value of PATH is
    "%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%" and you unpacked Argyll version
    1.1.0 in <span style="font-weight: bold;">d:\bin\</span>, then you
    would modify PATH to be
    "%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;d:\bin\Argyll_V1.1.0\bin". The
    change will take effect when you start a new command shell, which
    you start from Start Menu-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt, or
    Start Menu-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt. You can
    check that the environment variable has been set by running the
    command "echo %PATH%" in the command shell.<br>
    <br>
    The .zip file also contains several useful reference files (such as
    scanner chart recognition templates, sample illumination spectrum
    etc.) in the ref sub-directory, all the current documentation in a
    doc sub-directory, and instrument USB drivers in the libusb1
    directory.<br>

    wisdom) has removed the built in speaker driver, and now relies on
    systems having a sound card and speakers's installed and turned on

    <br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span> that if you wish to use
    Argyll tools (<a href="dispwin.html">dispwin</a>) to control display
    calibration, that you will have to disable any other calibration
    loader programs.<br>
    <br>
    Note also that there are other programs that will interfere with
    calibration loading, such as igfxpers.exe that gets installed with
    nVidia "Optimus" technology.<br>
    You may have to disable both the igfx tray module
    (c:\windows\system32\igfxtray.exe) and the igfxpph Module
    (c:\windows\system32\igfxpph.dll) in addition to the persistence
    Module (c:\windows\system32\igfxpers.exe).<br>
    <br>
    A good tool for this is <a
      href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902">AutoRuns</a>.
    Note that the igfxpph module may exist in several locations and you
    have to disable all of them. Reboot after changing settings.<br>

    [ The alternative to switching to the Argyll drivers is to go to the
    libusb-win32 web site, and download and then install the "filter
    drivers", - see
    &lt;http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net./#downloads&gt;. This may
    then let you access the device using Argyll, without disabling
    access by existing applications. (I haven't tried this, so I'm not
    sure how well it works). You don't make use of the Argyll <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">.inf</span> file using this approach. <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span> that a potential
    problem with this approach is that the filter drivers haven't been
    modified to have a longer USB control transaction timeout, and this
    may cause failures for certain instruments when measuring dark
    colors.]<br>
