<u>Installing the software on Microsoft Windows<br>

<h3 style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span
 style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Unpacking the .zip archive:</span></h3>
You will
need
to unzip the downloaded file in the location you have chosen to hold
the
executable files (perhaps somewhere like \bin). I would <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> put them in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">\Program Files</span>,
since spaces in directory or file names and command line environments
are a very bad mix, and will cause you endless problems. The
archive will create a <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> top
level directory <span style="font-weight: bold;">Argyll_VX.X.X</span>,
where X.X.X is the version number, and the executables will be in <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Argyll_VX.X.X/bin</span>.
<h3><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Making the utilities
accessible:</span></h3>
You should
also configure your %PATH%
environment
variable to give access to the executables from your command line
environment.<br>
<br>
For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vista</span>, look in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Menu -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; System And
Maintenance -&gt; System -&gt; Change Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt;
Environment Variables<br>
<br>
For <span style="font-weight: bold;">XP and 2000 </span>look in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;ControlPanel-&gt;System-&gt;Advanced-&gt;EnvironmentVariables<br>
<br>
For <span style="font-weight: bold;">NT 4</span> look in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;ControlPanel-&gt;System-&gt;Environment<br>
<br>
You want to add the directory you've chosen to your %PATH%, which is a
System Variable. Normally you would add this to the end of the current
setting, separated by a ';'.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;So if the current value of PATH is
"%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%" and you unpacked Argyll
version 1.0.0 in <span style="font-weight: bold;">d:\bin\</span>, then
you
would modify PATH to be
"%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;d:\bin\Argyll_V1.0.0\bin". The
change will
take effect when you start a new command shell, which you start from
Start Menu-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt, or Start
Menu-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt. You can check
that the environment variable has been set by running the command "echo
%PATH%" in the command shell.<br>
<br>
The .zip file also contains several useful reference files
(such as
scanner
chart recognition templates, sample illumination spectrum etc.) in the
ref sub-directory, all the current documentation in a doc
sub-directory, and instrument USB drivers in the libusbw directory.<br>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Serial Instruments:</span><br>
</h3>
If you are using a serial connected instrument, then there is nothing
special to do to enable this.<br>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">USB Instruments:</span></h3>
If you are using a USB connected instrument, then suitable USB drivers
may need to be installed:<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);"><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;">Fresh Install
of USB drivers:</span><br>
<br>
</span>If you currently don't have any applications that talk to your
instrument using USB, then it is relatively simple to use the drivers
provided with Argyll. On plugging the instrument in, MSWindows should
pop up a "New Hardware" dialog, and ask you for drivers for the
particular USB instrument.<br>
<br>
<a name="V_FNH"></a>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vista</span> a
"Found new
hardware" window will pop up.<br>
&nbsp; Select the top "Locate and install driver software
(recommended)"&nbsp; button.<br>
&nbsp; A "User Account Control" window will probably then pop up, and
you should "Continue".<br>
&nbsp; A "Found New Hardware" window should pop up. Select the last
"Don't Search online" button.<br>
&nbsp; In the next screen select the "I don't have the disc. Show me
other options." button.<br>
&nbsp; In the next screen, select the "Browse my computer for driver
software (advanced)" button.<br>
&nbsp; On the next screen use the brows dialog to locate the directory <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">argyll\libusbw </span>below where you
installed Argyll. Click "next".<br>
&nbsp; The screen should change to "Installing driver software...", and
a "Windows Security" window should pop up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the "Windows Security"&nbsp; window choose the "Install
this driver software anyway" button.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; You should get the final screen "The software for this
device has been successfully installed". Click "Close".<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></span><a name="X_FNH"></a>In<span style="font-weight: bold;"> XP</span>
a "Welcome
to the Found New Hardware Wizard" window will pop up.<br>
&nbsp; For "Can Windows connect to Windows Update to search for
software ?"&nbsp; Select "No, not this time" and "Next"<br>
&nbsp; Select "Install from a list or specific location (Advanced) "
then "Next"<br>
&nbsp; Select "Search for the best driver in these locations", "Include
this location in the search" and "Brows"<br>
&nbsp; Brows to locate the directory <span style="font-weight: bold;">argyll\libusbw</span>
below where you installed Argyll. Click "next".<br>
&nbsp; The screen should change to "Installing driver software...", <br>
&nbsp; You should get the final screen "Completing the Found New
Hardware Wizard". Click "Finish".<br>
<br>
<a name="2_FNH"></a>In<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 2000</span> a
"Welcome
to the Found New Hardware Wizard" window will pop up.<br>
&nbsp; Click "Next"<br>
&nbsp; Select "Search for a suitable driver for my device
(recommended)"
then "Next"<br>
&nbsp; Tick the "Specify a location" box and then "Next"<br>
&nbsp; A "Found New Hardware Wizard" dialog should pop up with "Insert
the manufacturer's installation disk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into the driver selected, and then clock OK'.&nbsp;
Select "Browse...".<br>
&nbsp; Brows to locate the directory <span style="font-weight: bold;">argyll\libusbw</span>
below where you installed Argyll, and select the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">.inf</span> file that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponds&nbsp; to the device (ie.
DTP94.inf, i1Disp.inf etc.). Click "Open".<br>
&nbsp; Click "OK".<br>
&nbsp; The screen should change to "Windows found a driver for this
device. To install the driver Windows found, click Next",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the path to the file you selected should
be shown bellow this. Click "Next".<br>
&nbsp; You should get the final screen "Completing the Found New
Hardware Wizard". Click "Finish".<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
</span>Note that the "Huey" colorimeter appears as an HID (USB Human
Interface
Device Class) device, and hence will be assigned to the default
MSWindows HID driver, rather than popping a "New Hardware" dialog. You
don't normally need to install an Argyll <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">libusbw</span> driver for the Huey.<br>
If
however your version of Argyll does not have HID driver support (no
DDK available when the software was built), then you will need to
change the "Huey" from the HID
driver to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">libusbw</span> driver
(see below).<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 153);"><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;">Adding Argyll
drivers to existing drivers:</span></span><br>
<br>
If you currently have applications other than Argyll accessing your USB
connected instrument, then you won't automatically be prompted to
install the drivers needed to access the instrument. You
have to manually install the drivers, and then switch back and forth
between the Argyll and other drivers if you want to switch between
applications. <br>

<br>
[ The alternative to switching to the Argyll drivers is to go to the
libusb-win32 web site, and download and
then install the "filter drivers", - see
&lt;http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net./#downloads&gt;. This may then
let you access the device using Argyll, without disabling access by
existing applications. (I haven't tried this, so I'm not sure how well
it works). You don't make use of the Argyll <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">.inf</span>
file using this approach. ]<br>
