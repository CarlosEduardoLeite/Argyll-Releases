Argyll CMS README file - Version 1.0.3
--------------------------------------

Date:   3rd September 2008

Argyll is an open source, ICC compatible color management system. It supports
accurate ICC profile creation for scanners, CMYK printers, film recorders and
calibration and profiling of displays. Spectral sample data is supported,
allowing a selection of illuminants observer types, and paper fluorescent
whitener additive compensation. Profiles can also incorporate source specific
gamut mappings for perceptual and saturation intents. Gamut mapping and profile
linking uses the CIECAM02 appearance model, a unique gamut mapping algorithm,
and a wide selection of rendering intents. It also includes code for the
fastest portable 8 bit raster color conversion engine available anywhere,
as well as support for fast, fully accurate 16 bit conversion. Device color
gamuts can also be viewed and compared using a VRML viewer. Comprehensive
documentation is provided for each utility, and a general guide to using
the tools for typical color management tasks is also available. A mailing
list provides support for more advanced usage.

This is Version 1.0.3, a bug fix update to 1.0.0 released in
July 2008. The last full release was in December 2005,

icclib was in November 1998, and of Argyll was in July 2000.
Code development commenced in 1995. See Changes Summary for an
